# Magic Eight Ball

## Solution

    //creates a variable for a username
    var username = '';

    //if code user inputs a username, first option is logged into the console, if not, second option is.
    username ? console.log(`Hello, ${username}!`) :
    console.log('Hello!');

    //user asks a question and greets the code user if they entered a name
    const userQuestion = 'Should I do it?';
    console.log(`Hi ${username}! ${userQuestion}`)

    //creates a random number variable and rounds down to the nearest whole number between 0 and 8.
    var randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 8);

    //creates a variable that can be changed later.
    let eightBall = '';

    //creates a switch statement that stores certain phrases in the var eightBall based on the case number that is decided by the randomNumber variable
    switch (randomNumber) {
    case 0 :
    eightBall = ('It is certain')
    break;
    case 1 :
    eightBall = ('It is decidedly so')
    break;
    case 2 : 
    eightBall = ('Reply hazy try again')
    break;
    case 3 :
    eightBall = ('Cannot predict now')
    break;
    case 4 :
    eightBall = ('Do not count on it') 
    break;
    case 5 :
    eightBall = ('My sources say no')
    break;
    case 6 :
    eightBall = ('Outlook not so good')
    break;
    case 7 : 
    eightBall = ('Signs point to yes') 
    break;
    default:
    eightBall = ('Try again.')
    break;
    }

    //prints the phrase
    console.log(eightBall);
